endpoints:
  /search:
    description: 'Returns a list of genes in a given KEGG pathway. Both taxon ID and pathway ID are required because KEGG does not have gene information about generic pathways'
    parameters:
      - name: taxon_id
        description: The NCBI ID of the species of the pathway.
        type: string
        required: true
        default: "3702"
      - name: pathway_id
        description: The KEGG ID of a pathway.
        type: string
        required: true
        default: "00010"
  /list:
    description: 'Returns a list of possible arguments of the search operation. Calling list with no fields returns a list of taxon IDs that KEGG has in its database. Note that KEGG does not have pathway data on all of these taxons. Calling list with a taxon ID will return a list of pathways in the taxon. This functionality is duplicated by the search endpoint for the kegg_pathways API.'
    parameters:
      - name: taxon_id
        description: The NCBI ID of the species to list the pathways of.
        type: string
        required: false

    description: 'KEGG API (application programming interface) allows customization of KEGG-based analysis, such as for searching and computing biochemical pathways in cellular processes or analyzing the universe of genes in the completely sequenced genomes.'
